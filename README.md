# Catnet RFCS

Catnet Request for Comments, both finalized and not. We still need to put a system in place to differenciate between the two, but since people don't
use what we're cooking up (yet!) this isn't strictly nessisary.

Each markdown file is nicely displayed and should provide enough in-depth information. If not, file and issue and look at the reference implementation.
